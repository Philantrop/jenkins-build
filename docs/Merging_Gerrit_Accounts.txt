1. Log in to the database:

    mysql -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PWD $MYSQL_DB

2. Let Gerrit find duplicate accounts:

    source /usr/local/bin/gerrit_load_merge.sql;

    If that gives you an "empty set" or a different result from what you expect,
    continue with 3.

3. select account_id,full_name,preferred_email,registered_on from accounts order by full_name;
    In the list, look for duplicate names, e. g. "Foo Bar" here:

    |        400 | Foo Bar              | foo@bar.net                     | 2015-05-08 17:31:58 |
    |       1380 | Foo Bar              | foo_bar@gmail.com              | 2015-06-16 01:47:44 |

    If there are no duplicates, the user lies. Otherwise, proceed to 4.

    If there are more than two accounts for the same person, you just repeat step 4
    as often as needed.

    If there are more than one duplicate accounts, e. g. twice "Foo Bar" and twice
    "Bar Baz", you just repeat step 4 several times.

4. Insert both related IDs into the "links" table, e. g.

    # insert into links values(duplicate,original);
    insert into links values(1380,400);

    You should always merge both accounts into the *older* one. There can be
    exceptions, though, on a case-by-case base.

5. Run the actual merge:

    source /usr/local/bin/gerrit_merge_accounts.sql;
    commit;
    quit;

    Note that you *must* commit *and* leave the mysql client at this point.

6. Check the result:

    select account_id,full_name,preferred_email,registered_on from accounts order by full_name;

    In our example, the ID 1380 should be gone.

7. Tell the user his account was merged. If it doesn't work immediately, he needs
   to log out and log in again. If it still doesn't work (has yet to happen), tell
   him to clear his cookies from galileo.mailstation.de *and* his cache.
   If it *still* doesn't work, show me *exactly* what you did. I might have to
   forcefully convince Gerrit to accept the merge (has happened once so far and
   might have been my fault :-) ).
